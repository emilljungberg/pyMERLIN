MERLIN is a method for Motion Estimation Retrospective correction Leveraging Interleaved Navigators. This repository contains python code (in ``pymerlin``) for performing motion correction on suitable MRI data. The example pipelines in ``pymerlin`` are specifically designed to be used with 3D radial, ZTE, acquisitions.


Installation
-----------------
Install the python tools for ``pymerlin`` with ``pip`` by cloning this repository and running the following command in the main folder::

	pip install -e .

Dependencies
-----------------
Besides the python dependencies listed in ``pymerlin/requirements.txt``, MERLIN is designed to be used with the 3D non-cartesian reconstruction toolbox `riesling <https://github.com/spinicist/riesling>`_. 

Usage
----------------
Further details about the usage is found in the documentation (insert link here).
