Getting Started
=================

pymerlin is a toolbox for doing motion correction of MERLIN acquisitions. It works together with `RIESLING <https://github.com/spinicist/riesling>`_. The main steps in the motion correction framework includes:

1. Divide the complete radial dataset into interleaves (``riesling``)
2. Reconstruct each interleave into low-resolution navigator images (``riesling``)
3. Register each navigator to a target navigator, typically the first one (``pymerlin``)
4. Correct the k-space data for each interleave and combine to a motion-corrected dataset (``pymerlin``)
5. Reconstruct the final motion corrected image (``riesling``)

Details of pipelines that implements this can be found on the :doc:`pipelines` page.

If you want to try ``pymerlin`` but don't have any data to try it with, a demo is provided in ``examples/sl_moco_demo``. This uses a 3D Shepp Logan phantom generated by ``riesling``, applies motion to the k-space data, and runs motion correction on it.
